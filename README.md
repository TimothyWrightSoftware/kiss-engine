Welcome to the KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) Engine
======

This "Engine" is a collection of "stb" style header files, written in pure C, and provide simple alternatives to other game libraries.  These are intended to
be dropped in for quick prototypes, and later replaced with more game-specific code if necessary.

This project is part of the Hand Made Network: <https://kiss.handmade.network/>
